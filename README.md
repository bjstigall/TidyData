##Data Files

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The data is divided into files.  The files are:
features.txt - List of all features.
activity_labels.txt - Links the class labels with their activity name.
subject_train.txt - Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
subject_test.txt - Subject labels.
X_test.txt - Test set.
Y_test.txt - Test labels.
X_train.txt - Training set.
Y_train.txt - Training labels.
